# HOW TO UPLOAD IMAGES
So, I know this is extremely bad practice, but I'll update this very soon. (learning everyday!)

To upload an image, we highly encourage users to go to google images, find an image, right click and click "copy image address" and paste into the proper field.

Again, very bad practice. My apologies. I plan to fix this README over the weekend.
